# Chrono Trigger MSU-1
Version 1.1
by DarkShock

This hack adds CD quality audio to Chrono Trigger using the MSU-1 chip invented by byuu.

The hack has been tested on bsnes-plus v073+1, higan 096 and SD2SNES. BSNES 070, 075 is NOT RECOMMENDED, use bsnes-plus v073.

For those playing on SD2SNES, you need to exit to its menu using the L+R+Select+X shortcut in order to save your game.

Note that there are two patches:
1. `chrono_msu1.ips` for emulators prior to higan v096 and SD2SNES without resume support.
2. `chrono_msu1_resume.ips` for higan v096 and up and SD2SNES with resume support.

If you hate the fact that dungeon music restarts at the beginning with no-resume patch, delete chrono_msu1-69.pcm.

## Installation
1. Buy the [Chrono Trigger Symphony](http://www.thechronosymphony.com/) albums (volumes 1 through 3) in FLAC format ().
   1. Extract each album to a sub-directory under this directory with a name similar to `Chrono Trigger Symphony Vol X (FLAC)` where `X` is the volume number. For example, volume 1 should be extracted to a folder named `Chrono Trigger Symphony Vol 1 (FLAC)`
2. Run `make_music_pack.bat` to create the music pack.
3. Create a copy of your original ROM named `chrono_msu1.sfc`.
4. Patch the ROM using Lunar IPS or Floating IPS (http://www.smwcentral.net/?p=viewthread&t=78938).

Please support the original author of the album. I know some sites will host the complete music pack in PCM format, I do not endorse them at all.

## Using higan
1. Launch it using higan.
2. Go to `%USERPROFILE%\Emulation\Super Famicom\chrono_msu1.sfc` in Windows Explorer.
3. Rename `program.rom` to `chrono_msu1.sfc`.
4. Copy `manifest.bml` and the .pcm file there.
5. Launch the game.

## Using on SD2SNES
1. Rename the patched ROM file to `chrono_msu1.sfc`.
2. Drop the ROM file, `chrono_msu1.msu`, and the .pcm files in any folder under the root folder of the SD2SNES' SD card. (I really suggest creating a separate folder)
3. Launch the game and voilï¿½, enjoy !
